# asm6502

This is an Assembler / Disassembler for the 6502 microprocessor.
At some point, I might try and add an emulator...

This is a work-in-progress. I'm doing this for the fun...

* 2025-01-04: Disassembler seems to be working.

## Usage

### Disassembler

`./asm6502 -d [-l <load_address>] <hex_file>`

### Assembler

`./asm6502 [-o <hex_file>] <source>`
